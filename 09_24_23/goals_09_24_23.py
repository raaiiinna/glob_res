'''
make mf/fs plots for 4, 3.5, 3, 2.67, 2
make plots of N sink produced over time, then also make plot of fs/N. (<m>). 

notes: ID and number of total sink is pretty different number.(which is prefered? i think case can be made for ID, but N seems like more standard practice.

what should i put as legend? total mass?

is <M> graph as expected?

play with axis ratios?
