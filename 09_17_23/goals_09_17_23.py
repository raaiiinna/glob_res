goals for today:

make best plots as possible for each m value

figure out what the end time is for each output chosen, use that as label

try to figure out how to fix mass function, does it give same information?

should I figure out how to give m4.00 on graph? how do i convey this information? as a title?

need massimos help to fix what bins look like for mf

why is MF graph cutting off at 1.5 on x axis?

should I pick values prioritizing even spacing in time or on the graph?

m3.00 goes over bounds on fs plot. should i change bounds of all or just ones that go over? should i use 10^4?
