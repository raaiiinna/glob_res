'''
make new plots using new script from massimo
what mtot should i use for the theory curve since not all can be shown?
maybe the final mtot? is my assumption
(should I put a label on this theory line since it is particular mtot?)
what should the seperation be between picked outputs--same question as last time
what should the range of the y and x axis be? should i standardize y? (some will go over) 
- should i include the metallicity as a subtitle or as text on the graph?
maybe play with fill patterns of mf to make reading it more clear? how should i make this readable?
